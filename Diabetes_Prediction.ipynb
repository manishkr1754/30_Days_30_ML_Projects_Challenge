It occurs when either the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin (a hormone that regulates blood sugar) or when the body can't effectively use the insulin it produces. This results in elevated blood sugar levels, which can lead to various health complications if not managed properly.\n\nThe goal of this project is to leverage machine learning **to predict whether an individual has diabetes or not based on certain medical variables**. This falls under **Classication Machine Learning Problem**. This prediction can be valuable for early diagnosis and intervention which can improve the management of diabetes.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2) Understanding Data\n---\nThe project uses Diabetes data which contains several medical variables (independent variables) and one outcome variable (dependent variable) for each individual.\n\n### Dataset Description:\n\n- **Pregnancies:** The number of times a woman has been pregnant.\n- **Glucose:** Plasma glucose concentration measured 2 hours after an oral glucose tolerance test.\n- **BloodPressure:** Diastolic blood pressure (in mmHg).\n- **SkinThickness:** Triceps skin fold thickness (in mm).\n- **Insulin:** 2-hour serum insulin level (in μU/ml).\n- **BMI (Body Mass Index):** A measure of body fat based on weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.\n- **Age:** The age of the individual in years.\n- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** A score that indicates the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.\n- **Outcome:** The outcome variable with two possible values:\n  - 0: Indicates that the individual does not have diabetes.\n  - 1: Indicates that the individual has diabetes.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3) Getting System Ready\n---\nImporting required libraries\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport
