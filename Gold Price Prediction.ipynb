Prices can fluctuate wildly based on a variety of factors including economic conditions, geopolitical events, and supply and demand. As a result, it can be difficult for investors to accurately predict the price of gold.\n\nThe goal of this project is to leverage machine learning **to develop a machine learning model that can predict the price of a used car based on its features**.

Here are the key inferences based on the correlation coefficients:\n\n1. **SPX (S&P 500 Index):**\n   - Correlation Coefficient: 0.049345 (Positive, but weak correlation)\n   - There is a very weak positive correlation between the S&P 500 Index (equity market) and the price of gold. This means that changes in the S&P 500 Index do not strongly influence changes in gold prices.\n\n2. **USO (United States Oil Fund):**\n   - Correlation Coefficient: -0.186360 (Negative, but weak correlation)\n   - There is a weak negative correlation between the United States Oil Fund (representing oil prices) and the price of gold. This suggests that there is a slight tendency for gold prices to move in the opposite direction of oil prices, but the correlation is not strong.\n\n3. **SLV (Silver Price):**\n   - Correlation Coefficient: 0.866632 (Strong positive correlation)\n   - There is a strong positive correlation between the price of silver and the price of gold. This indicates that gold and silver prices tend to move together, and changes in silver prices are highly correlated with changes in gold prices.\n\n4. **EUR/USD (Euro to US Dollar Exchange Rate):**\n   - Correlation Coefficient: -0.024375 (Weak correlation)\n   - There is a very weak correlation between the Euro to US Dollar exchange rate and the price of gold. Changes in the exchange rate do not appear to have a significant impact on gold prices.\n\nOverall, the strongest correlation is observed between gold ('GLD') and silver ('SLV') indicating that these two precious metals tend to move in the same direction. The correlations with the S&P 500 Index, USO and EUR/USD are relatively weak, suggesting that other factors may have a greater influence on gold prices. Keep in mind that correlation does not imply causation and multiple factors can affect gold prices including economic conditions, geopolitical events, and investor sentiment.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 6) Model Building\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Creating Feature Matrix (Independent Variables) & Target Variable (Dependent Variable)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# separating the data and labels\nX = gold_price_df.drop(columns = ['GLD'], axis=1) # Feature matrix\ny = gold_price_df['GLD'] # Target variable","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"X","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"y","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data Standardization","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\nscaler = StandardScaler()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"scaler.fit(X)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"standardized_data = scaler.transform(X)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"standardized_data","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"X = standardized_data","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"X","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Train-Test Split","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, RandomizedSearchCV\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=45)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(X.shape, X_train.shape, X_test.shape)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(y.shape, y_train.shape, y_test.shape)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Model Comparison : Training & Evaluation","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# For Model Building\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, Lasso, Ridge\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVR\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"models = [LinearRegression, Lasso, Ridge, SVR, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor]\nmae_scores = []\nmse_scores = []\nrmse_scores = []\nr2_scores = []\n\nfor model in models:\n    regressor = model().fit(X_train, y_train)\n    y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)\n    \n    mae_scores.append(mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))\n    mse_scores.append(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))\n    rmse_scores.append(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred, squared=False))\n    r2_scores.append(r2_score(y_test, y_pred))","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"regression_metrics_df = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"Model\": [\"Linear Regression\", \"Lasso\", \"Ridge\", \"SVR\", \"Decision Tree Regressor\", \"Random Forest Regressor\"],\n    \"Mean Absolute Error\": mae_scores,\n    \"Mean Squared Error\": mse_scores,\n    \"Root Mean Squared Error\": rmse_scores,\n    \"R-squared (R2)\": r2_scores\n})\n\nregression_metrics_df.set_index('Model', inplace=True)\nregression_metrics_df","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Inference\n\nIn the context of predicting gold prices,\n- The **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)** and **Random Forest Regressor** stand out as the top models for gold price prediction showcasing low prediction errors (MAE, MSE, RMSE) and a high degree of explained variance (R-squared). \n- The Decision Tree Regressor also performs well but falls slightly behind. \n- Conversely, Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge models display comparatively higher errors and less variance explanation, making them less suitable for accurate gold price forecasting.
